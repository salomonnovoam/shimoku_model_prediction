    "                f'<li>Min Samples Leaf (7): The minimum number of samples required to be at a leaf node. This parameter further guards against overfitting by smoothing the model.</li>'\n",
    "                f'<li>Max Features (log2): The number of features to consider when looking for the best split. Using \"log2\" features reduces variance but increases bias.</li>'\n",
